## What is 61418?

61418 was born February 24th, 2026.

It was founded by [Mike Letts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lettsmichael/) in order to bring together software engineers who build and maintain open-source software which enhance the AWS Python SDK and general AWS ecosystem under one roof.

61418 has a bias for Python and modern Python tools like [Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo), [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), etc. We are open to maintaining projects written in other languages as well, so long as they are thoughtful, modern, and bring value to the AWS ecosystem.
